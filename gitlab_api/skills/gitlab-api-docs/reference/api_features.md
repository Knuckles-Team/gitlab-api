# Feature flags API
  * Tier: Free, Premium, Ultimate
  * Offering: GitLab Self-Managed


This API is for managing Flipper-based feature flags used in development of GitLab.
All methods require administrator authorization.
Notice that the API only supports boolean and percentage-of-time gate values.
## List all feature flags[](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/features/#list-all-feature-flags "Permalink")
List all persisted feature flags, with their gate values.
```
GET /features
```

shell
```
curl --request GET \
  --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/features"
```

Example response:
json
```
[
  {
    "name": "experimental_feature",
    "state": "off",
    "gates": [
      {
        "key": "boolean",
        "value": false
      }
    ],
    "definition": null
  },
  {
    "name": "my_user_feature",
    "state": "on",
    "gates": [
      {
        "key": "percentage_of_actors",
        "value": 34
      }
    ],
    "definition": {
      "name": "my_user_feature",
      "introduced_by_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40880",
      "rollout_issue_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244905",
      "group": "group::ci",
      "type": "development",
      "default_enabled": false
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "new_library",
    "state": "on",
    "gates": [
      {
        "key": "boolean",
        "value": true
      }
    ],
    "definition": null
  }
]
```

## List all feature flag definitions[](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/features/#list-all-feature-flag-definitions "Permalink")
List all feature flag definitions.
```
GET /features/definitions
```

shell
```
curl --request GET \
  --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/features/definitions"
```

Example response:
json
```
[
  {
    "name": "geo_pages_deployment_replication",
    "introduced_by_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/68662",
    "rollout_issue_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/337676",
    "milestone": "14.3",
    "log_state_changes": null,
    "type": "development",
    "group": "group::geo",
    "default_enabled": true
  }
]
```

## Create or update a feature flag[](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/features/#create-or-update-a-feature-flag "Permalink")
Create or update a feature flag’s gate value. If a feature flag with the given name doesn’t exist yet, it’s created. The value can be a boolean, or an integer to indicate percentage of time.
Before you enable a feature still in development, you should understand the [security and stability risks](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/feature_flags/#risks-when-enabling-features-still-in-development).
```
POST /features/:name
```

Attribute | Type | Required | Description
---|---|---|---
`name` | string | yes | Name of the feature to create or update
`value` | integer or string | yes |  `true` or `false` to enable/disable, or an integer for percentage of time
`key` | string | no |  `percentage_of_actors` or `percentage_of_time` (default)
`feature_group` | string | no | A Feature group name
`user` | string | no | A GitLab username or comma-separated multiple usernames
`group` | string | no | A GitLab group’s path, for example `gitlab-org`, or comma-separated multiple group paths
`namespace` | string | no | A GitLab group or user namespace’s path, for example `john-doe`, or comma-separated multiple namespace paths. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/353117) in GitLab 15.0.
`project` | string | no | A projects path, for example `gitlab-org/gitlab-foss`, or comma-separated multiple project paths
`repository` | string | no | A repository path, for example `gitlab-org/gitlab-test.git`, `gitlab-org/gitlab-test.wiki.git`, , `snippets/21.git`, to name a few. Use comma to separate multiple repository paths
`runner` | string | no | A runner ID, or comma-separated list of runner IDs
`force` | boolean | no | Skip feature flag validation checks, such as a YAML definition
You can enable or disable a feature for a `feature_group`, a `user`, a `group`, a `namespace`, a `project`, a `repository`, and a `runner` in a single API call.
shell
```
curl --request POST \
  --data "value=30" \
  --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR_TOKEN" \
  --url "https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/features/new_library"
```

Example response:
json
```
{
  "name": "new_library",
  "state": "conditional",
  "gates": [
    {
      "key": "boolean",
      "value": false
    },
    {
      "key": "percentage_of_time",
      "value": 30
    }
  ],
  "definition": {
    "name": "my_user_feature",
    "introduced_by_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40880",
    "rollout_issue_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/244905",
    "group": "group::ci",
    "type": "development",
    "default_enabled": false
  }

### Set percentage of actors rollout[](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/features/#set-percentage-of-actors-rollout "Permalink")
Rollout to percentage of actors.
```
POST https://gitlab.example.com/api/v4/features/my_user_feature?private_token=YOUR_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
value=42&key=percentage_of_actors&
```

Example response:
json
```
{
  "name": "my_user_feature",
  "state": "conditional",
  "gates": [
    {
      "key": "boolean",
      "value": false
    },
    {
      "key": "percentage_of_actors",
      "value": 42
    }
  ],
  "definition": {
    "name": "my_user_feature",
    "introduced_by_url": "https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/40880",

  }
}
```

Rolls out the `my_user_feature` to `42%` of actors.
## Delete a feature[](https://docs.gitlab.com/api/features/#delete-a-feature "Permalink")
Delete a feature flag gate. Returns the same response whether the feature flag exists or not.
```
DELETE /features/:name
```
