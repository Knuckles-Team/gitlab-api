# REST API third-party clients
  * Tier: Free
  * Offering: GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated


You can integrate third-party API client libraries with GitLab. The following libraries are maintained by community members and not officially supported by GitLab. Report bugs and feature proposals to the respective projects.
For questions about these integrations, use the [GitLab community forum](https://forum.gitlab.com/).
Administrators can monitor usage of these API clients by [parsing logs](https://docs.gitlab.com/administration/logs/log_parsing/#print-top-api-user-agents).
