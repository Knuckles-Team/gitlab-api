# Use of generative AI
Some content on `docs.gitlab.com` was created with the assistance of generative AI tools. All content, AI-generated or human-created, is reviewed for accuracy and readability by a GitLab team member.
Translations of English documentation into other languages are created using a mix of human translation, automation, and AI-assisted translation. AI-assisted translations can appear in the documentation before human review is complete, or with only limited human review, to give non-English users faster access to the latest information. AI-assisted translations will be reviewed by a human and updated as needed for quality and accuracy. The English language documentation serves as the authoritative source.
For more information about making AI-generated contributions to GitLab documentation, see our [DCO or our CLA terms](https://about.gitlab.com/community/contribute/dco-cla/).
